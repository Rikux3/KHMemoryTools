# KHMemoryTools
This repository consists of multiple parts.
* MemoryScan is a library which does all sorts of Read/Write commands to Processes. This uses much of [Teamod's](https://github.com/GovanifY/Teamod) code.
* AntiFormTrainer is a tool to be used in combination with the [Nightmare-Sora Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWzSg3pfXMs).
* KHTriggerRunner triggers on certain rooms/events and executes codes.
* KHMovesetScanner let's you scan an characters MSET and modify it on the fly. Inspired by Xaddgx Absol Brasse's Moveset Mod Videos.

While MemoryScan and AntiFormTrainer are considered stable, I gave up on KHTriggerRunner after a certain while. KHMovesetScanner works, but is clunky in usability and not able to mod every detail of an MSET.
I warned you :)

I would like to thank the following persons who helped me directly and indirectly creating this tools: CrazyCatz00, GovanifY, Xaddgx, SoraikoSan, Topaz, Vlad, and anyone who i probably forgot.
